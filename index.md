## Overview

Good teachers have a significant impact on student learning. Although we recognize the importance of the role played by educators, most educational systems still have difficulty finding a fair evaluation for their professors and courses. UH Class Critics is a service that allows students from the University of Hawaii at Manoa to share their experiences taking different college courses and professors and rating them, similar to [RateMyProfessor](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/). Students can evaluate their teachers and courses based on criteria they care about, ranging from course workload to class participation. The tool allows students to show the positive and negative points of their university and their course. 

Our goal is to provide a convenient and readily accessible website where students can research and make the best decisions about courses they plan to take based on the reviews as well as share their experiences with the courses and professors already taken and critiquing them. The inspiration for the project came from the lack of information when it comes to choosing courses and teachers at the beginning of each semester, when the student has to choose and plan carefully the courses he will take. In UH Class Critics, it is possible to include information from courses in the areas of business, health, economics, technology and marketing, among others. Knowing what past students struggled to learn is a step ahead for any student.

## Why Should We Review Professors and Their Courses?


In general, all professors expect their students to develop complex skills in the most diverse areas and disciplines. Making these expectations come true involves the ability of students to assess classes they are currently enrolled and their instructors. A teaching strategy must always be subject to evaluation, both to improve the work for those already in the classroom and to promote the entry of those who are still thinking of taking a particular course. 

The data obtained from the reviews are generally used as constructive comments that serve to assess the development of a teacher. In this way, professors who are underperforming will have the opportunity to self-assess, improve their performance, and help to maintain the quality of an educational institution. When students are satisfied with the methodology, they will identify the most efficient teachers to always maintain the high quality of the education.


## Current Vision for Development

Currently, we are in the stage of developing this service for all students at UH. You can view our repo [here](https://github.com/uh-class-critics/uh-class-critics). Our vision for the layout of this service will reflect features such as:

- Landing Page
- Sign in/Sign up Page
- Browse Classes Page
- Review Course Page
- Review Professor Page

Generally, we would like each review to have:

- The semester the course was taken.
- The class name
- The professorâ€™s name
- Various star ratings (Difficulty, Importance to major, etc)
- A textual description of the course.
- Cost of course (materials, textbooks, etc.)
- Average number of hours spent studying per week.
- Final grade


Ideally, we want our service to look something like the following:

## Landing Page

## Browse Professors Page

## Professor Overview Page

Students who have taken those classes will be able to provide a feedback about their professors, rating them, and advising future students.

## Write Review Page

In this page, the student will be able to either rate the professor or the course. He can choose the level of difficulty, provide information about the materials used, format of the class, his final grade, etc.
