## Overview

UH Class Critics a service that allows students from the University of Hawaii at Manoa to share their experiences taking different college courses and professors and rating them, similar to [RateMyProfessor](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/).

Our goal is to provide a convenient and readily accessible website where students can research and make the best decisions about courses they plan to take based on the reviews as well as share their experiences with the courses and professors already taken and critiquing them.
